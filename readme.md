# LesserPass
An opinionated, spiritual fork of [LessPass](https://github.com/lesspass/lesspass/).

## What is LesserPass?
LesserPass is a stateless password manager that generates passwords deterministically instead of storing them.

## What’s new in v1.0.0
Now that I’ve finished the first full release, I guarantee that future versions will not change the password generation logic. This ensures consistent, deterministic outputs from here on out.

## Differences compared to LessPass

#### IMPORTANT: No password parity
While LesserPass uses the same techniques to generate secure and strong passwords, it **does not** and **will never** offer password parity.

#### More unique / experimental features
While LessPass focuses on stability and minimal but solid functionality, I personally like to experiment with new features.

A few examples that are already implemented or may be added in future updates include:
- ##### Custom character sets
- ##### Quick filtering for custom character sets
- ##### Automatic login generation based on the current URL
- ##### URL alias support for deprecated site names or custom sites
- ##### More URL formatting options (specifically ports)
- ##### Autofill for one page login screens.
- ##### And more! Check out the current changelog to see planned features.

#### Minimal monochrome design
In comparison to LessPass’s mostly modern web design, I personally prefer a minimal two-color approach with no wasted space.

## Disclaimer
If anyone from the LessPass team see's this, i dont hate yall, i actually love your project and just wanted a few extra bits on top of it which lead me to make my own version ^^
